# sorting_algorithm_visualizer
Visually demonstrates how sorting algorithms work.

# Python Modules Used
- pygame
- random
- time

# How To Use
This program currently only works for screens which have a screen size of 1200 x 750, or over.
Once the program is loaded you can select a sorting algorithm.
When you have a sorting algorithm selected you can use the menu at the bottom of the window to go through the step by step sorting process.
The go button starts going through the steps at the default speed. The stop button stops the sorting process. To change the speed you can press the slow, default, and or fast button. To manually go through each step you can press the back and next buttons to go one step back and forth. The start button returns the array to its original form. The finish button skips to the end of the sorting process to when the array is already sorted.

# Supported Sorting Algorithms

- Insertion Sort
