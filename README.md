# sorting_algorithm_visualizer (Still being created!)
Visually demonstrates how sorting algorithms work.

# Needs To Be Done
- Implement more sorting algorithms.
- Menu to change algorithms in the window.
- Improve increase speed function, so that it goes faster.
- Step back button, this will be done by saving the state of the array every step in the sorting process.

# Python Modules Used
- pygame
- random
- time
